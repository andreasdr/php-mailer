1. Mailer

1.1 What is it?

	This is a small and easy to use mailer class set which is capable of:

		- Sending UTF8(only) mails (subject and content)
		- Using text/plain and text/html
		- Sending an text/plain alternative if using text/html(using customized html2text)
		- Sending attachments

1.2 Why?

	I developed Mailer because I did not find an easy to use, light open source solution.

1.2 Who did this?

	Mailer was programmed by Andreas Drewke at SlipShift GmbH. SlipShift allowed me to open source this! Thank you. Maybe someone has a use for it.
